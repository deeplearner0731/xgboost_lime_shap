## Permutation Test for Continuous Outcomes

This folder contains the permutation test code for continuous outcomes under the **XGBoostML** framework. The script outputs:

- The global permutation *p*-value (based on 100 permutations by default)
- Train and test AUC metrics for subgroup identification

You can modify the number of permutations (e.g., increase from 100 to 500) by adjusting the loop settings in the code.

### Extending to Binary or Time-to-Event Outcomes

To apply the permutation testing procedure to binary or time-to-event outcomes, replace the A-learning and weight-learning components using the appropriate notebooks:

- `XGBoostML_LIME_SHAP_binary.ipynb`   for binary outcomes  
- `XGBoostML_LIME_SHAP_time_to_event.ipynb` for time-to-event outcomes
